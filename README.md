### Abstract
About 20% of the approximately 5,000 species of mammals are bats (order Chiroptera [meaning “hand wing”]). Among mammals, bats are unique in their ability to fly, and are found on all continents except Antarctica. Bats serve an important role in insect control and pollination of food crops, and their excrement (“guano”) is used as fertilizer and in the manufacture of soaps, gasohol and antibiotics. However, bats are unfortunately also increasingly being recognized as reservoir hosts for viruses which can cross species barriers to cause infections in humans and other animals.

The ability of bats to fly allows for efficient virus spread, and viral transmission from bats has been suspected in a number of major emerging infectious disease outbreaks. These include outbreaks of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and others. Of late, there has been significant interest in the scientific literature about bat associated viruses, which has in fact culminated in an online browsable database of bat associated viruses (DBatVir). [2]

The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has acutely raised the importance of studying bat related coronaviruses, as the current hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was derived from a bat coronavirus, perhaps through an intermediate host. [3] Therefore, elucidating the predisposing factors that make it more likely for a bat to carry coronavirus would be important to help us understand how the current COVID-19 pandemic started and spread, and find ways to reduce the risk of such pandemics in the future.

In our study, we collected published information on coronavirus positivity from various bat species and merged this information with publicly available datasets on bat characteristics, geographical, and environmental features. Models were then fit with the final aim of predicting the prevalence of coronavirus positivity of a particular bat species. Factors associated with a higher coronavirus positivity among bats were identified and plausible mechanisms discussed.
